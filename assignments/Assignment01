On the url http://localhost:8080/dashboards/serviceweekend-dashboard you can see (under the product sales graph) a Deployments table.

The columns are name/starttime/deadline/success ratio/patches and compliancy %

We have the following API endpoints:

command to start the json-server = npx json-server generate.js (from src\db folder)

  \{^_^}/ hi!

  Loading generate.js
  Done

  Resources
  http://localhost:3000/deployments
  http://localhost:3000/devices
  http://localhost:3000/patches

  Table should show the following for each deployment:

  name = name
  starttime = day fullmonthname year + time
  deadline = day fullmonthname year + time
  success ratio = X/Y 
                    where X is the number of Success from Devices from the deployment (see devices endpoint and do a count of Success for that deploymentID )
                    where Y is the number of total devices for the deployment
  Patches = number of patches (count of patches in the deployment)
  Compliancy = % for the success ratio based (so if 100 devices and 25 are 'Success' = 25%)
